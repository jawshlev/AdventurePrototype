A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes). The opening, win & lose, and the first instance where the player sees the tree scene are all based on Adventure Scene.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes). The Scene with the worm at the corner store isn't based on AdventureScene, and the scene where the player can pick between the raccoon and the worm is not based on Adventure Scene.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).  I simplified my scene by making the option to click the worm unavailable after the user picks up the banana.
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes). Demo1 (Initial Tree Scene), Demo2 (inside the tree), Demo3 (outside the tree at a crossroads between the worm and the raccoon), Demo4 (Worm scene, interaction so you can get the key)
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: unsatisfied (describe two examples) (Worm, and the Raccoon)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: unsatisfied (describe two examples) (The granadilla has a pointer over message, the worm and raccoon have several pointet over messages depending on whether or not you have the key)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (describe two examples) (There are pointer down effects on both the worm and the Raccoon, the raccoon's pointer down effects change depending on if the user has a banana or not)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples) (N/A)

Asset sources:
- For most of my scenes I made them in Procreate
- I used the wood texture brush on Procreate to make the tree seem more realistic
- I used a reference to draw the Granadilla, and used multiple layers within procreate to enhance the detail on the first appearence
- of the Granadilla
- For the Raccoon I used a reference image and drew and colored it in on procreate
- For the worm, many of the worm's clothes I drew from a reference, like the Cookies hoodie and the Louis Vuitton belt
- All other assets were drawn from memory
- All references used were found by googling the name of the item being referenced

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
